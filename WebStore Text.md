Images only show some of the available items, to much to show :)

The following provides the current abilities of the released extension for use within the Boomi Web Platform:

* Keyboard Shortcuts
  * Ctrl+Alt + S = Save Current Flow
  * Ctrl+Alt + T = Test Current Flow
  * ~ = Toggle Full Screen - On/Off
* Adjustments to the portal for integration around font sizing, header and menu sizing to provide more build and processing space within the default view.
* Account dashboard now defaults to 7 days instead of the maximum value.
* Shapes that don't have a end connection will glow.
* Quickly add stop shape to flow by hovering over end arrow and clicking stop.
* Add components directly within the build tab by double clicking the flow and selecting from a drop down.
* Capture the entire flow without resize and save to a local image by using the "Capture Process Flow" button above the build canvas.
* Hover over flow shape to see the connection points it make.
* Use notes to group tasks and provide information relating to multiple areas of the flow.
* Add Markdown in the process description or notes to show better visual formatting.
* When tables (for example Process Reporting list view) is displayed there's an option to "Toggle Line Wrapping" available to maximize screen real estate.
* Ability to assign keyboard button to easily go into and out of Full Screen Mode - default is the `~` key.
* JSON & XML Viewing toggle added to Message and Notify Shapes; will format the JSON and add the ' quote padding automatically.
* SQL Viewing toggle added to Command shape.

  * Options available are - Use Transparent Background, Zoom Size and Ability to Expand all notes to capture the note detail
* Debug has been enhanced to provide more robust coloring, this includes glowing colors, item selection and error emphasis.
* Ability to Remove the Canvas Build Background (dots) which works well with dark modes.

* Define a custom refresh period and have process reporting auto refresh to your needs.
* Expand the Element Selection Screen within Shapes to provide more visual room for ease of use.
* Platform Status Detail - Shows if operational or if any Boomi systems are not operational.
