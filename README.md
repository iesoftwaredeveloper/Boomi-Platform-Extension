<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The Boomi Platform Enhancer Extension came about from the need to adjust the current default Boomi Web Platform IDE and display to provide a more desirable layout and adjustments to make development and general usage with in the Boomi Cloud platform more robust. 


Here's why:
* I wanted more functionality and better overall setup; so instead of waiting I just did.
* Boomi takes community feedback however its not perfect and unless its gets a score of XXX it does not really get a look at and to me these feel a must.


### Built With
The main frameworks of this extension are the following + the ide used.
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
* [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)



## Getting Started

To get started simply visit the [Chrome WebStore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/boomi-platform-enhancer/behhfojpggobllhaifocfcampokbfhko") and install the addon; once done it will auto-enable when on the Boomi Web Platform.
